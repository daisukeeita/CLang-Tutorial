# C LANGUAGE TUTORIAL

> This is just my own learning progress in C Language and how I understand its concept.
> My progress will be noted here
> Goodluck to me! 😁

> This is based on ['Learn C Programming with Dr. Chuck'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaPN51Mm5qQ) and ['The C Programming Language'](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)

#### Chapter 2 Challenges

- [x] Basic Data Types and Variables
- [x] Arithmetic Operations
- [x] Conditional Statements
- [ ] Loops

  - Challenge: Implement a program that prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers. Use a loop to calculate and display the series.

- [ ] Functions

  - Challenge: Write a function that takes two integers as parameters and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). Create a main function that prompts the user for two numbers and displays their GCD.

- [ ] Arrays

  - Challenge: Create a program that allows the user to input 5 integers into an array. Then, calculate and print the sum and average of these integers.

- [ ] Simple Text-Based Application
- Challenge: Develop a simple text-based menu-driven application that allows a user to perform basic operations like:

  - Add two numbers
  - Subtract two numbers
  - Multiply two numbers
  - Divide two numbers

Each operation should be handled by a separate function, and the program should loop until the user chooses to exit.
